# localhost

## What even is?

localhost is a meetup app that connects locals with traverllers who are looking to skip the tourist traps for a more authentic local experience.  localhost is built with React, node.js, socket.io, Auth0, and postgreSQL.

## Quick start

- Clone the repo, then run `npm install`.  From there, run `npm start` to start the server, and in another terminal window, run `npm run compile`.  The app should now be accessable via browser at localhost:3000.
